The game itself can be run by simply opening the file Panic_at_the_Pizzarizzia.html in your browser.

Controls:
After the game is started by clicking "START" players have 30 seconds to select a set of four actions to take in a turn. The player's card (the panel to the side of the map that contains a portrait and four action boxes) can be navigated with a combination of the arrow and wasd keys. The left and right arrows move the highlight box to show which action is being altered. The action can be selected with the up and down keys (actions cycle through walk -> throw -> interact -> wait), and a wasd key press will determine which direction you would like to complete this action in.

To interact with a station simply use the interact action (depicted by hands) with the direction set to be toward the station.
